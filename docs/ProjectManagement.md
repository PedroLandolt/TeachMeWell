### Retrospective of Iteration 2:
In this release, we implemented a search feature and the possibility of seeing every teacher at UP, except the ones at FAUP, FBAUP, FFUP and FMDUP. The app now warns the user if the input is invalid and allows them to choose a faculty to see its teachers. We also implemented acceptance tests and unit tests. 

### Retrospective of Iteration 3:

#### Did well:

 - Changed rating process and parameters.
 - Implemented user login/register.

#### Do differently:

 - Divide user stories into smaller ones.

#### Puzzles:

 - Using the app, tapping the system's back button leads the user to the login page.


### Retrospective of Iteration 4:

#### Did well:

 - Implemented profile page.
 - Added persistent login (last iteration's puzzle).
 - Login as guest.
 - Professors now display their rating average.

#### Do differently:

 - Correctly estimate the amount of time it would take to implement certain features.

##### Puzzles:

 - Couldn't figure out how to limit ratings to professors who are lecturing the students at the moment of the rating.
